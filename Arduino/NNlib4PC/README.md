This version of NNetLib30 is configurated for hardware more powerful than ARDUINO. Can be used in any environment or IDE C++. This version has just disabled function used in ARDUINO environment and vice versa.

Directory <code>MNIST-Test</code> includes a environment for MNIST prediction using a pretrained NN. Read <code> README.txt</code> for more details.
